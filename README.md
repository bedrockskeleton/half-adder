# Half Adder Circuit

A half adder is a circuit meant to compute the first place of binary addition.

In the diagram, the half adder (HA) takes two inputs, A and B, as the two binary numbers to add. The **S**um is outputted through **S**, and **C**~out~ is the digit to **C**arry.

A half adder is comprised of two logic gates: a XOR and an AND gate. The XOR gate handles the sum, while the AND gate determines the carry value
