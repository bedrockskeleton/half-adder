# Half Adder Circuit

A half adder is a circuit meant to compute the first place of binary addition.

In the diagram, the half adder (HA) takes two inputs, A and B, as the two binary numbers to add. The **S**um is outputted through **S**, and **C**<sub>out</sub> is the digit to **C**arry. The half adder itself is made with two logic gates: a XOR and an AND gate. The XOR gate handles the sum, while the AND gate determines the carry value.

Since a half adder is made with logic gates, it can be recreated with integrated circuits. The integrated circuits I'll be using are simply multiple logic gates packed onto one chip.
